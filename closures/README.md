# Closures


In Python, closures are a programming concept where a nested function remembers the values from its enclosing scope, even if that scope has finished executing.

## Why use closures?
- To maintain state in a fuction without using global variables or classes.
- To create function factories.
- To implement data hiding an encapsulation.
