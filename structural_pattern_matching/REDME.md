# Structural Pattern Matching


leads to more elegant, concise, and readable code writtern in a **declarative** style.

resemblance to siwtch statement in C-family languages is **deceptive**. The classic switch statement controls the execution flow based on the exact value stored in a variable. It effectively works as a chained sequence of mutually exclusive if..elif... equality comparisons, but with a more succinct and readable syntax.

Each pattern describes the structure of an object to match, including its type, shape, value, and identity. It can also specify the individual pieces of which an object is made.


## Takeaway

- selective data extraction from complex data structures.
